School assignment to make a Quiz


The requirements were:

The quiz must contain 10–15 questions.
Users should be able to answer all questions and view their results after completion.
Display the number of correct answers. Use color and text to communicate results according to these criteria:
Less then 50% — Failed (red).
50%–75% — Good (yellow/orange).
More then 75% — Really well done (green).
Questions should include a mix of the following types:
True/false statements (two answer options: True or False).
Multiple choice (four answer options with one correct answer).
Checkbox answers (four checkboxes with 2–3 correct answers, the rest incorrect).
Users should be able to toggle between dark mode (dark background with light text) and light mode (light background with dark text).
When results are displayed, users should see exactly which questions they answered correctly and incorrectly.
Technical requirement: The code must follow the "DRY" principle (Don't Repeat Yourself), avoiding major code repetition in the logic.
